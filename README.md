My PWP for the Stache House barber shop

## Milestone 1 Feedback

Purpose, Audience, and Goal is very short and to the point - it specifies exactly what you want to accomplish and gives info about what you would like the finished site to contain - such as scheduling, location, and other points. Good job here.

Your Use Case section is done very well. You start off by providing a perfect reason for someone to visit the Stache House website, and continue through the story until you reach success brought on from your website - it was pretty entertaining as well. 

One thing to keep in mind as you develop this website is to make sure you keep the site looking aesthetically pleasing to viewers, especially with the content you want to include. For example - for the map functionality, you'll need to do some research on how do to this properly and without slowing down your site (it's pretty simple to integrate Google Maps using their API, which we will go into later in the class.) 

One thing I want to give you extra props for is that you used a % on the image size, rather than a pixel amount. Keep following this practice throughout your time in the class and after if possible.

-  This isn't a big issue, but watch your spelling as you continue through the class.
-  In the future, it would be preferred if you created a "media" subdirectory within your documentation directory. This will help to keep your images and code separate and organize your entire project - especially when you have 50 images within one project. 

All in all, great job! You've passed milestone 1 in tier IV, and you may now move on to milestone 2a. Keep it up.

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Excellent wireframes! You've done a great job outlining both the content strategy and layout of this site. Nice work. 

Your layout choices will be a breeze to develop using the Bootstrap framework. We'll be going over that topic next week.
In the meantime, I would use this time to gather assets for the site such as your images, content, and other info you'll be needing prior to development. Also, you can use this time to consider your specific design choices (branding, colors, fonts, etc.), and to research 3rd party tools you may want to consider using. (More on that below.)

I think it's a great idea to link to the shop's appointment scheduling system. This button/link would be a "call to action" for the user, so think about making this stand out visually in an aesthetic and tasteful way.

For the location map, you'll want to use the Static Google Maps API. It's very simple, so have a look here: 
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/

If Stache House does not have a Google Account already, you'll definitely want to set one up for them. If they do, have their  gmail address handy so you can grant them access to the map and any other assets. Setting them up with Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools would also be a nice touch! (Also easy.)

For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward.

You may want to consider using an image slider to feature pictures of the shop. The Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the [Flickity Slider](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/), the [Owl Carosel](http://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) or [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly.

For custom fonts, I recommend using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Prior to our in-class coverage on the Bootstrap framework, have a look at the [Official Bootstrap Documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/) and the [Deep Dive Bootstrap Material](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/bootstrap/).

When you do begin development, you'll build your page on `index.php` directly inside your `/public_html` directory.

Really nice work here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
