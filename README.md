## Milestone 1 Feedback

Purpose, Audience, and Goal is very short and to the point - it specifies exactly what you want to accomplish and gives info about what you would like the finished site to contain - such as scheduling, location, and other points. Good job here.

Your Use Case section is done very well. You start off by providing a perfect reason for someone to visit the Stache House website, and continue through the story until you reach success brought on from your website - it was pretty entertaining as well. 

One thing to keep in mind as you develop this website is to make sure you keep the site looking aesthetically pleasing to viewers, especially with the content you want to include. For example - for the map functionality, you'll need to do some research on how do to this properly and without slowing down your site (it's pretty simple to integrate Google Maps using their API, which we will go into later in the class.) 

One thing I want to give you extra props for is that you used a % on the image size, rather than a pixel amount. Keep following this practice throughout your time in the class and after if possible.




### Edits &amp; Suggestions
-  This isn't a big issue, but watch your spelling as you continue through the class.
-  In the future, it would be preferred if you created a "media" subdirectory within your documentation directory. This will help to keep your images and code separate and organize your entire project - especially when you have 50 images within one project. 





All in all, great job! You've passed milestone 1 in tier IV, and you may now move on to milestone 2a. Keep it up.
